CALCULATE SCORE TESTS

FIRST TEST IS A PASS

NOTE: This test was conducted as a trial test to make sure pytest is working its magic correctly, turns out I had to use the command (pytest -s) as it gave me this error (ERROR test_blackjack.py - OSError: pytest: reading from stdin while output is captured!  Consider using `-s`.)
