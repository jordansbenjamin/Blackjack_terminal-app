##### DEALER SECTION #####

# TODO 1: Create empty dealer cards list

# TODO 2: Create dealers function which involves logic of dealers turns and play
    # TODO 3: Dealer doesn't have to draw another card if certain conditions are met: Player bust, dealer score higher, or dealer has BJ

    # TODO 4: If dealers hand score is under 17, keep drawing cards (use while loop)
