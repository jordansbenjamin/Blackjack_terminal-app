## Features

##### The Player (user)
- Involves logic of how the user interacts and plays the game to win

The player (user) will go against the dealer (computer) for the highest dealt hand up to 21, there are 3 ways the player can win the game:

- If the players hand (cards they recieve) totals to a score of 21, that is a Blackjack and instant win.
- If the players hand total score is higher than the dealers hand, then the player wins.
- If the dealers hand goes over 21, the dealer busts and the player automatically wins the game no matter what card they have.

##### The Dealer (computer)
- Involves logic of how the computer interacts with the game and conditions for it to win

There are 3 ways for the dealer (computer) to win the game:

- If the dealer receives a total card score of 21, that is a blackjack and the player automatically loses. Even if the player has a Blackjack as well.
- If the players total card score is lower than the dealers hand, then the dealer wins.
- If the player overpulls and recieves a total card score over 21, the dealer wins.

However, there is one way for the game to end at a draw:

- At the end of both turns, if the player (user) and dealer (computer) both have the same total card score other than 21, itâ€™s a draw.

##### Main/starting menu

The player will be introduced to the games Menu, just before the game begins, the player has options to do the following:

- The player has the option to start the game instantly, whenever they are ready.
- The option to read instructions.
- The option to read house rules.
- The option to look at the scores of previous games played.

The player will be given the option to go back to the main menu after finishing a game or to continue playing straight away.

## Code Styling

The Blackjack game was created using Python3, and creating it I followed the conventions and guidelines set by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw and Nick Coghlan with their [PEP 8 - Style Guide For Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

Code layout conventions such as using 4 spaces of indentation, the consistency of tabs over spaces for indentation. The use of block comments and the use of whitespace in expressions and statements.

Most importantly out of all, the use of descriptive variable and functions names, adding to that I also only used 2 global variables, which follows the convention of having minimal/no global variables.
